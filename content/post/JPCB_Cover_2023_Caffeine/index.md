Hofmeister laid out the foundation of ion-specific effects, but the underlying physical mechanisms have puzzled researchers for more than a century. Hand-in-hand, experiment and computer simulations show how the heavily consumed psychoactive drug caffeine is affected not only by the type of salt, illustrated by “ionic candy”, but critically on the concentration regimes of caffeine and electrolyte, respectively.
